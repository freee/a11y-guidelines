********************************************************
About the Version Number of the Accessibility Check List
********************************************************

For convenience, version numbers are provided for the accessibility check list.
As of the time of writing this document, the version is noted in cell A10 of the first sheet.

Starting from V3.0.0, version numbers consist of three digits separated by periods (.): major version number, minor version number, and revision number.
For example, if the version number is 3.0.1, the major version number is 3, the minor version number is 0, and the revision number is 1.

Each number is updated according to the following guidelines:

Major Version
   In case of significant changes, such as changes in the structure of the check list.
Minor Version
   In case of additions, deletions, or changes in the intent of existing check items.
Revision
   In case of changes that do not affect the results of the check, such as typo corrections or changes in wording without changes in intent.
